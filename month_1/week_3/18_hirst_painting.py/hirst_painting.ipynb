    "Day 18 brought me back to Turtle Graphics. After working through a few turtle-themed challenges (draw a square, draw a dashed line, draw different shapes, generate a random walk and draw a spirograph), I was prompted to the day's final project, the recreation of a contemporary art project in form of a Hirst painting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements were:\n",
    "- Recreate the Hirst color palette from an existing painting\n",
    "- Position the turtle on the left side of the painting, drawing in a straight line the defined number of dots, restart at the line above from the left until all dots have been drawn\n",
    "- Do not show the line of the turtle \n",
    "- Do not show the turtle for a pleasant viewing experience"

    "For this to work, we were supposed to find and save a picture of one of Damien Hirst's dot drawings online and then extract the colors by using colorgram. By printing the extracted colors to my terminal, I was able to get the RGB-codes. After checking for white (background) and eliminating that from the list, I was able to define my color list for the project."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I really enjoyed working on this project! Extracting colors from an image and then using those colors to create a dot painting with the turtle graphics module was a fun and creative experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the colorgram library to pull colors from an image was super cool. It felt like I was doing some real image processing and learning about color theory at the same time.\n",
    "- Drawing the dots with the turtle module was a great way to get more comfortable with Python’s graphics capabilities.\n",
    "- It was a good practice for using loops, conditionals, and libraries in Python.\n",
    "- Figuring out how to position the turtle correctly to make a nice grid of dots took a bit of trial and error, but it was worth it.\n",
    "- Setting the turtle to its fastest speed was a neat trick to make the drawing process quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project was a fantastic mix of coding and creativity. It’s inspired me to think about more ways to combine programming with visual art, and I’m excited to try out similar projects in the future."
