I wanted users to easily navigate through the drink menu, see the status of their order, and understand when ingredients needed replenishing. Using tools like PrettyTable for displaying information and clearing the screen after each interaction helped in creating a clean and organized interface. "

    "Handling errors and unexpected situations was a significant challenge. I needed to anticipate what could go wrong‚Äîlike users entering incorrect inputs or the program encountering interruptions. Implementing error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage these scenarios and guide users back on track was essential to ensure a smooth user experience. This really used up most of my time - getting all the small details right while not destroying the overall functionality of the program was a steep learning curve."
