    "# The Automated Motivational Email Sender\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I developed an Automated Motivational Email Sender that leverages Python to send motivational quotes via email on a scheduled basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- The script is designed to check the day of the week and specifically sends motivational quotes every Monday. This automation ensures that the recipient receives a positive message at the start of each week, fostering motivation and engagement.\n",
    "- On the designated day, the script reads from a file containing a collection of motivational quotes. It selects a random quote to ensure variety and surprise, making each message unique.\n",
    "- Utilizing Python's smtplib, the script connects to an email server to send the selected quote. This demonstrates practical use of email automation for maintaining personal connections and providing encouragement.\n",
    "- Sensitive information such as email credentials will be handled securely using environment variables to ensure that they are not exposed in the code."
