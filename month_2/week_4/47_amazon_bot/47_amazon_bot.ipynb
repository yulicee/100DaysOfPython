    "## Amazon Price Tracker with Email Alert System\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of a course assignment, I developed this Python program to track product prices on Amazon and automatically send an email alert when the price drops below a predefined target. The project leverages web scraping techniques to extract product information such as the current price and title, compares the price to my set threshold, and sends me a notification when a deal is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This automation not only serves as a practical tool for real-world price monitoring but also demonstrates the power of Python for handling web data and email integration. By building this system, I was able to explore key concepts like web scraping, data extraction, and email automation, all while solving a problem that many shoppers face.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a project that combines both technical learning and practical application, showcasing how programming can simplify everyday tasks and enhance efficiency."

    "### Technical Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web Scraping**:\n",
    "   The script uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to the Amazon product page. The response contains the HTML content, which is then parsed using the `BeautifulSoup` library to extract relevant data. Specifically, we look for:\n",
    "   - Product title: Found in the HTML element with the `id=\"productTitle\"`.\n",
    "   - Product price: Extracted from the element with the `class=\"a-offscreen\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Price Comparison**:\n",
    "   The scraped price is converted from text to a float and compared with a predefined target price that is stored in an environment variable (`TARGET_PRICE`). If the price is below the target, the program proceeds to send an email.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Email Alert**:\n",
    "   The email is sent using Python’s `smtplib` library, which connects to Gmail’s SMTP server (or another email provider’s server). The email credentials (username, password, and server details) are securely stored in the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   The program includes error handling for:\n",
    "   - Failed HTTP requests when fetching the product page.\n",
    "   - Inability to find or extract price and title data from the HTML.\n",
    "   - Errors during email login or sending the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.env` file is used to securely store the following:\n",
    "- **SMTP_ADDRESS**: The address of the email SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n",
    "- **EMAIL_ADDRESS**: Your email address from which the alert will be sent.\n",
    "- **EMAIL_PASSWORD**: The app-specific password for the email (if 2FA is enabled).\n",
    "- **TARGET_PRICE**: The price that triggers the alert."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This price tracking and email alert system automates the process of monitoring product prices on Amazon, making it easier to track price drops and receive notifications in real-time. It offers a practical way to ensure you're always aware of the best deals without having to manually check the prices yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, I gained valuable experience in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web scraping with requests and BeautifulSoup to extract data from web pages.\n",
    "- Handling exceptions and errors, which are common in real-world web scraping scenarios.\n",
    "- Automating email notifications using the smtplib library.\n",
    "- Managing sensitive information securely using the .env file and dotenv package.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, I hardcoded the Amazon product URL since this is an exercise. However, the script can be easily modified to accept dynamic URLs, making it more versatile. By adjusting the TARGET_PRICE and URL, the system can be customized to track any product on Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project could be further developed by adding features like price history logging, tracking multiple products at once, or extending the scraper to other online retailers, making it a strong foundation for more advanced applications."
