    "# Stock Market Alert App\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone who has never really been interested in the stock market, I nevertheless was curious about this project which made me create a system that not only tracks stock price changes but also keeps me updated with the latest news related to those changes. The goal was to build a practical tool that could help me stay informed about significant fluctuations in stock prices and their potential causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenges I Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling API Data: One of the first challenges was to correctly fetch and process stock data from the Alpha Vantage API. It required careful parsing of the JSON responses to extract relevant information such as closing prices for consecutive days.\n",
    "- Calculating Price Changes: Calculating the percentage change in stock prices posed its own set of difficulties. Ensuring accurate calculations and handling edge cases, such as very small or very large differences, was crucial.\n",
    "- Fetching and Processing News: Integrating the News API to fetch articles related to significant stock price changes required careful setup and parameter tuning. It was challenging to filter and format the news to be informative and concise.\n",
    "- Sending SMS Alerts: Finally, integrating Twilio to send SMS alerts was a significant milestone. Configuring the Twilio API and handling message formatting were key aspects of this step. Ensuring that each message was clear and informative while keeping within the SMS character limits was a crucial part of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Importing Libraries: Setting up and securely managing sensitive information using environment variables.\n",
    "- Fetching Stock Data: Retrieving daily stock prices for a specific company.\n",
    "- Calculating Changes: Determining the percentage change in stock prices and assessing its significance.\n",
    "- Fetching News: Obtaining related news articles if the price change exceeds a certain threshold.\n",
    "- Sending Alerts: Formatting the articles and sending them via SMS using Twilio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important: Implement Your Own Information\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook successfully, you will need to replace the placeholders with your own details:\n",
    "- API Keys: You need to obtain and set your own API keys from Alpha Vantage and News API. Replace STOCK_API_KEY and NEWS_API_KEY with your personal keys.\n",
    "- Twilio Credentials: Sign up for a Twilio account and get your own Twilio SID and Auth Token. Replace TWILIO_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN with these values.\n",
    "- Phone Numbers: Update VIRTUAL_TWILIO_NUMBER with your Twilio phone number and VERIFIED_NUMBER with the phone number where you want to receive alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can securely store these values as environment variables or directly replace them in the code. Make sure to keep your sensitive information private to avoid any security risks."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I’ve just wrapped up this cool project where I built a stock price alert system, and it’s been quite a ride! Here’s the scoop on what made it both exciting and challenging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Juggling**: I had to pull data from two different APIs – one for stock prices and one for news. Getting the data and making sure it’s accurate was like piecing together a puzzle. It was tricky to handle the JSON responses and extract the right information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crunching Numbers**: Figuring out the percentage changes in stock prices and deciding if they were significant enough to send an alert was a bit of a brain teaser. I had to ensure the calculations were spot on, which took some fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **News Sorting**: Finding relevant news articles and making sure they were formatted nicely for the alerts was another challenge. I wanted to make sure the news was useful and easy to understand, which meant a lot of attention to detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Texting with Twilio**: Integrating Twilio to send SMS alerts was pretty cool but also had its quirks. I had to make sure the messages were formatted correctly and within the character limits, which took some trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it’s been a really deep learning experience! I’ve learned a lot about working with APIs, automating tasks, and making sure everything works together smoothly. I’m pretty proud of how it turned out!"
