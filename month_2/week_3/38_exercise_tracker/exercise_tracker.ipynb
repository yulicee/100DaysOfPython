    "# **Personal Workout Tracker Project with Nutritionix and Sheety APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I set out to build a personalized workout tracker that integrates with two APIs: Nutritionix for retrieving exercise details and Sheety for logging the data into a Google Sheet. The project aimed to deepen my understanding of API interactions, HTTP requests, and secure handling of sensitive data using environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I worked through this project, I encountered challenges such as handling complex API responses, managing authentication securely, and working with Python's `datetime` module for accurate time tracking. This notebook documents the process, from the initial setup to the final implementation, highlighting the technical intricacies of each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Requirements**\n",
    "- Setup API Credentials and Google Spreadsheet\n",
    "- Get Exercise Stats with Natural Language Queries\n",

    "- In the root directory of this project (where the notebook is located), create a file named `.env`.\n",
    "- In this file, you will store your API keys and other sensitive information. The `.env` file should look like this:\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was a comprehensive exercise in integrating multiple APIs and managing HTTP requests within Python. The process of securely handling API keys, parsing complex JSON responses, and ensuring the integrity of time-based data were a steep learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges I encountered, particularly with API authentication and data formatting, involved quite some time spent with debugging and iteration. The result is a functional, automated workout tracker that not only provides instant feedback on exercises but also seamlessly logs this data into a Google Sheet for tracking over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvements could include expanding the types of data logged, integrating additional health metrics, or enhancing the user interface for better interactivity."
